# Kick-Off

```
NOTE:

The repository is intended for beginners in ethical hacking. This is how I began my journey in ethical hacking. I won't insist that everyone follows the same path. The right thing to do is to observe the path and make your own path. Make your own path.

I will constantly update this information untill I think I have cleared a beginner level.
